During this week I have done the following things:
* Working with files: program can now compress file using huffman algorithm
* Program can now encode original text and decode the encoded content back to original
* working on the logic of application

### Project progress
Program works partially, it can compress texts using Huffman algorithm.

### What have I learnt during this week
