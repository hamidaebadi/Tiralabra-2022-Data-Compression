# Weekly Report no. 2

### What have I done during this week
During this week I have done the following things:
* The program's requirements updated.
* Choosing user interface : I decided to provide CLI user interface to interact with program.
* Design and implement the the CLI partially.
* Design and implement the Utilitiy-class providing main logid of the program partially.
* Design and implement the CompressData-class providing an abstraction level for using Utility-class.
* Design and impelement the Node-class as a building block of Huffman coding tree.
* Working on Huffman codings as building blocks of compression algorithm.
* adding unittest library and testing the main logics of the program.

### Project progress
Program works partially, it can compress texts using Huffman algorithm.

### What have I learnt during this week
- I learnt how to implement Huffman tree and how to use it for encoding and reducing the size of the original text.
- How to use codecov, GitHub Actions

### What to do next ?
 - continue developing CLI
 - implement the decoding algorithm with Huffman coding
 - Read about Lempel Ziv algorithm
 - Developing a File Handler class for interacting with textfiles
 - Adding more tests

### Any feedbacks or question ? 
 - Nothing

 ### Used hours:
 10 h
